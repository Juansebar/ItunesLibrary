## Fact about app

- Once you tap a song and navigate to the MusicDetailViewController, there is an imageView that you can tap to reveal more information about the song.


## Future Features
Having more time I would have liked to add the following features:

1. Add empty state to MusicFeedViewController whenever no results are returned from the Itunes Search API.

2. Add an activity indicator when data is being fetched so users with slow connection know that the app is loading and provide a better user experience.

3. Improve Launch screen of app

4. Finish delegating errors to show alerts to the user.

5. Add unit test to both modules (MusicFeed and MusicDetail) and extension files to ensure functionality.

6. In MusicDetailViewController I would try to research more how to obtain an image with higher resolution than the one provided by the iTunes Search API

7. Add volume control to MusicDetailViewController
